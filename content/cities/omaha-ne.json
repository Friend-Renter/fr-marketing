    {
      "q": "How do bookings work in Omaha?",
      "a": "Everything runs through the FriendRenter app: add the host as a friend → get accepted → confirm your booking → meet at an agreed public spot."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I have to be friends to book?",
      "a": "Yes—friends-only. Send a friend request (or include it with your booking request) and wait for host acceptance to confirm."
    },
    {
      "q": "Where do pickups usually happen?",
      "a": "Common spots are public garages/lots around Old Market, Midtown Crossing, or neighborhood centers. Your host will specify the exact location in the app."
    },
    {
      "q": "Airport pickup at Eppley (OMA)?",
      "a": "Often the rideshare lot or another public area near the terminal. Curbside handoff is at the host’s discretion and may depend on airport rules and timing."
    },
    {
      "q": "Busy nights in Old Market?",
      "a": "Event nights can be crowded—plan extra time and pick a garage with predictable access for both pickup and return."
    },
    {
      "q": "Who sets deposits, age, and requirements?",
      "a": "Hosts do. Deposit amount, minimum age, and any extra requirements are host-defined and shown before you book."
    },
    {
      "q": "Mileage limits and extra fees?",
      "a": "Hosts set mileage limits and any extras (e.g., cleaning). You’ll see limits up front, and any overages are settled afterward."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I extend my booking?",
      "a": "If the car’s available, yes. Request the extension in the app ahead of time so the host can approve."
    },
    {
      "q": "Tolls, fueling, and return condition?",
      "a": "Return fuel to the agreed level and follow any host return notes. Tolls/incidentals are reconciled after the trip."
    },
    {
      "q": "Smoking, pets, and house rules?",
      "a": "Hosts choose the rules. Review the listing for smoking/pets and cleaning expectations before you confirm."
    },
    {
      "q": "Protections and photo steps?",
      "a": "Bookings include clear protections plus photo check-in/out. Coverage details and responsibilities are shown before you confirm."
    },
    {
      "q": "What if I need to change or cancel?",
      "a": "Manage it in the app. The host’s policy applies; you’ll see timing windows and any fees before you finalize changes."
