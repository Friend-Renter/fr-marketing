    {
      "q": "How do bookings work in Lincoln?",
      "a": "All requests happen in the FriendRenter app: add the host as a friend → get accepted → confirm your booking → meet at a public spot for pickup."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I have to be friends to book?",
      "a": "Yes. Bookings are friends-only. Add the host as a friend (or request and add at the same time) and wait for acceptance before confirmation."
    },
    {
      "q": "Where do pickups usually happen?",
      "a": "Public, well-lit spots—often near Haymarket, UNL perimeter, or major shopping areas. Your host will share the exact meeting point in the app."
    },
    {
      "q": "Game day tips near Memorial Stadium?",
      "a": "Plan ahead—downtown traffic and parking fill fast. Agree on a garage or lot outside the closure zone and allow extra time for both pickup and return."
    },
    {
      "q": "Winter weather tips in Lincoln?",
      "a": "Allow time to clear snow/ice, drive cautiously, and take check-in/out photos. If conditions look severe, coordinate pickup timing with your host in the app."
    },
    {
      "q": "Who sets deposits and age requirements?",
      "a": "Hosts do. Deposit amounts, minimum age, and any additional requirements are set by the host and shown before you book."
    },
    {
      "q": "Are there mileage limits or extra fees?",
      "a": "Hosts choose mileage limits and any extras (e.g., cleaning). You’ll see limits up front; any overages are settled after the trip."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I extend my trip?",
      "a": "Usually—if the car’s available. Request an extension in the app before your return time so the host can approve."
    },
    {
      "q": "What about fueling and tolls?",
      "a": "Return the car at or above the agreed fuel level. Tolls and incidental charges, if any, are reconciled after the trip."
    },
    {
      "q": "Smoking, pets, and other house rules?",
      "a": "Hosts set the rules. Check the listing for smoking/pets and any cleaning expectations before you book."
    },
    {
      "q": "Insurance and protections?",
      "a": "Bookings include clear protections and required photo check-in/out steps. You’ll see coverage details and responsibilities before confirming."
    },
    {
      "q": "What if plans change or I need to cancel?",
      "a": "Use the app to modify or cancel. The host’s policy applies; you’ll see timing windows and any fees before you confirm changes."
